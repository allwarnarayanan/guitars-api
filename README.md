# guitars-api
This is a simple implementation of a rest api microservice.  
It is intended to give a quick example of what a rest api
might look like implemented.  Please use for reference only, knowing
that a production application would most likely be very different.

Please, feel free to fork/clone this for your own learning / teaching 
purposes.  I would appreciate a shout out if you share it, but it 
is not required.  Comments or questions are also welcome as well.

Thanks,

Rob
